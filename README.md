# extraChIPs_vignette

Given the requirement for loading in a relatively large number of reads across across the genome, even restricted to chromosome 10, this repository contains the actual data and source code for the extraChIPs vignettes.
RMarkdown files are compiled to produce markdown files, which are then copied manually into the main repository for extraChIPs.
The eventual aim is to create ExperimentHub objects for this data.
