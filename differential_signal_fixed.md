extraChIPs: Differential Signal Using Fixed-Width Windows
================
true

# Introduction

The [GRAVI](https://github.com/smped/GRAVI) workflow, for which this
package is designed, uses sliding windows for differential signal
analysis in a manner similar to the package `csaw`, but also
incorporating `macs2` peaks. However, the use of fixed-width windows, as
is common under DiffBind-style (Ross-Innes et al. 2012) approaches is
also possible with `extraChIPs`
